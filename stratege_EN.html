            <h2>TOMMY SHELBY: THE STRATEGIST</h2>
            <h3>The mind behind the Shelby empire</h3>
        </div>
        <section id="1">
            <h4>The Character</h4>
            <div class="contenu">
                <p class="1"><span>Thomas Michael Shelby</span>, nicknamed Tommy, is the mastermind of the Shelby family
                    and the architect
                    of their meteoric rise. Born in the dark streets of Small Heath in Birmingham, this former
                    sergeant-major
                    from World War I transformed a gang of petty criminals into a formidable commercial empire. His
                    strategic
                    vision and boundless ambition set him apart from his peers.</p>
                <p class="2"><span>Throughout six seasons</span>, Tommy evolves from an illegal bookmaker to a
                    legitimate businessman
                    and even a Member of Parliament. This transformation comes at a price: each victory deepens the
                    chasm
                    between the man he was and the man he becomes. His journey illustrates the permanent tension between
                    his working-class origins and his aristocratic aspirations.</p>
                <p class="3"><span>Tommy's strengths</span> lie in his tactical intelligence, his ability to anticipate
                    his opponents'
                    moves, and his magnetic charisma. He possesses a rare gift for turning every obstacle into an
                    opportunity.
                    However, his weaknesses run just as deep: his inability to trust, his inner demons from the war, and
                    his obsessive need to control everything, which often alienates those he loves.</p>
                <p class="4"><span>"I'm not a traitor to my class. I am just an extreme example of what a working man
                        can achieve"</span>
                    - This quote perfectly encapsulates the essence of Tommy Shelby. Other iconic phrases like
                    "Everyone's
                    a whore, Grace. We just sell different parts of ourselves" or "The one who keeps everybody's
                    secrets,
                    gets to be the leader" reveal his cynical yet lucid vision of the world around him.</p>
            </div>
        </section>
        <section id="2">
            <h4>Psychology of the Strategist</h4>
            <div class="contenu">
                <p class="1"><span>Tommy Shelby's tactics</span> resemble a permanent game of chess. He always thinks
                    several moves
                    ahead, anticipating his adversaries' reactions before they even make their decision. His method
                    rests
                    on three pillars: information (he controls everyone's secrets), psychological manipulation, and the
                    ability to identify his enemies' weaknesses. He often uses calculated provocation to force his
                    opponents
                    into making mistakes.</p>
                <p class="2"><span>His relationships with other characters</span> are complex and often toxic. With
                    Arthur, his older
                    brother, he maintains a protector-protected dynamic tinged with guilt. Polly represents the only
                    person
                    capable of truly confronting him. Grace, then Lizzie, embody his impossible quest for love and
                    redemption.
                    His enemies, from Campbell to Mosley, are never simply adversaries but pieces in his grand design.
                </p>
                <p class="3"><span>War trauma</span> haunts every decision Tommy makes. The tunnels of France forged his
                    resilience
                    but also his nightmares. His PTSD manifests through hallucinations, chronic insomnia, and emotional
                    distress that he masks behind a facade of coldness. The war taught him that survival requires
                    sacrifices,
                    a lesson he applies mercilessly in the criminal world.</p>
                <p class="4"><span>Tommy's obsession with control</span> is both his greatest strength and his curse. He
                    must plan
                    everything, foresee everything, master everything. This compulsion pushes him to dangerous extremes
                    and prevents him from truly delegating or trusting. When events escape his control, like Grace's
                    death,
                    he temporarily disintegrates before reconstituting himself, harder and more determined than ever.

            <h4>Key Moments</h4>
            <div class="contenu">
                <p class="1"><span>Among the most striking scenes</span>, the first face-off with Campbell immediately
                    establishes
                    Tommy as a formidable adversary against the authorities. The shootout at the Garrison, where he
                    methodically
                    eliminates Kimber's men, demonstrates his capacity for violent action. The wedding with Grace
                    represents
                    a rare moment of vulnerability before everything collapses. The failed hanging in Season 4 reveals
                    his
                    psychological limits, while his speech in Parliament marks his social apex.</p>
                <p class="2"><span>Decisions that changed the course of history</span> include the BSA arms theft that
                    launches the
                    entire plot, the choice to forgive Michael despite his betrayal which plants the seeds of the final
                    conflict, and the alliance with Alfie Solomons that constantly oscillates between cooperation and
                    confrontation. His decision to enter politics fundamentally transforms the nature of his ambitions
                    and puts him in contact with enemies of a completely different magnitude.</p>
                <p class="3"><span>His greatest strategic masterstrokes</span> demonstrate his tactical genius:
                    orchestrating Billy
                    Kimber's execution while seizing his territory, turning the situation against Inspector Campbell by
                    exposing his corruption, manipulating the Italian mafia and the Jews into killing each other, and
                    above all, his ability to professionally resurrect after each apparent defeat. Every victory is
                    calculated
                    with surgical precision.</p>
                <p class="4"><span>Perhaps the most revealing moment</span> remains his final conversation with Polly
                    before her death,
                    where she tells him: "You're not a man of peace. You're a man of war." This recognition of his true
                    nature, which he tried so hard to reform, encapsulates the tragedy of Tommy Shelby: a man who
                    aspires
                    to legitimacy and peace but whose skills and instincts are exclusively forged for conflict and
                    conquest.</p>

            <h4>Episode Analysis</h4>
            <div class="contenu">
                <p class="1"><span>"Episode 1.01"</span> masterfully establishes all elements of Tommy's character. The
                    opening sequence,
                    where he rides through Birmingham's industrial streets, immediately positions him as a romantic yet
                    dangerous figure. His interaction with Grace at the Garrison reveals his vulnerability hidden
                    beneath
                    the hardness. The plan to steal the weapons demonstrates his overwhelming ambition, while his
                    confrontation
                    with Campbell foreshadows the central conflict of the early seasons.</p>
                <p class="2"><span>In "Episode 3.06"</span>, Tommy's wedding to Grace was meant to represent his
                    definitive social
                    ascension. The decryption of this episode reveals how every visual element - from the immaculate
                    suit
                    to the grandeur of Arrow House - symbolizes his transformation. But Grace's assassination by the
                    Italian
                    mafia brutally destroys this illusion of normalcy. Tommy's reaction, moving from celebration to
                    mourning
                    to cold vengeance, encapsulates his complex psychology.</p>
                <p class="3"><span>"Episode 4.06"</span> where Tommy attempts to hang himself represents his lowest
                    point. The analysis
                    reveals how this scene culminates all accumulated losses: Grace, his innocence, his mental health.
                    The symbolism of the horse that interrupts him - an animal representing both freedom and destiny -
                    suggests that Tommy cannot escape what he is. His survival is not a victory but a condemnation to
                    continue his tortuous path.</p>
                <p class="4"><span>Season 5 finale "Episode 5.06"</span> demonstrates Tommy's strategic genius against
                    Mosley. Although
                    his assassination plan fails, the episode reveals the multiple layers of his preparation. The final
                    betrayal, suggesting someone very close sold him out, establishes the dramatic stakes of the final
                    season. The analysis of this episode shows how Tommy, even in defeat, plants the seeds of his future
                    retaliation, proving that his true power lies in his unshakeable resilience.</p>
