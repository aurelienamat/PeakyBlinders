            <h4>Birmingham 1920</h4>
            <div class="contenu">
                <p class="1"><span>Birmingham in the 1920s</span> was the industrial heart of England, a city of smoke,
                    red bricks,
                    and striking contrasts. Small Heath, the working-class neighborhood where the Shelbys operate,
                    represented
                    the brutal reality of post-war life: factories as far as the eye could see, cobblestone streets
                    greasy
                    with soot, and a population marked by poverty and the traumas of world conflict. It's in this
                    oppressive
                    setting that the Shelby family builds their empire.</p>
                <p class="2"><span>Post-war England</span> goes through a period of profound upheaval. Thousands of
                    soldiers return
                    from the front, traumatized and disillusioned, to a country struggling to offer them a future.
                    Unemployment
                    explodes, social tensions intensify, and veterans like the Shelbys use their military skills in
                    organized
                    crime. This era also sees the rise of extreme political movements, from communism to fascism,
                    creating
                    fertile ground for gangster ambitions.</p>
                <p class="3"><span>Small Heath and its adjacent neighborhoods</span> form a fascinating microcosm. The
                    Garrison Pub
                    serves as the unofficial headquarters, narrow streets facilitate territorial control, and
                    metalworking
                    factories provide both cover jobs and racketeering opportunities. Horse markets, clandestine
                    racetracks,
                    and smoke-filled back rooms constitute the infrastructure of organized crime. Every street corner
                    has
                    its history, every pub its loyalties.</p>
                <p class="4"><span>The true history of the Peaky Blinders</span> dates back to the 1890s-1910s. These
                    street gangs
                    took their name from the peaked caps they wore, although the myth of razor blades sewn into them is
                    largely exaggerated. They controlled illegal betting and protection rackets. The series takes
                    considerable
                    creative liberties but captures the essence of this era when urban gangs wielded real power in
                    British
                    working-class neighborhoods.</p>

        <section id="2">
            <h4>The Shelby Family</h4>
            <div class="contenu">
                <p class="1"><span>The Shelby family tree</span> reveals a complex dynasty. At the top, Arthur Shelby
                    Sr., the absent
                    and unreliable father. His children: Arthur Jr., the unstable and violent older brother; Tommy, the
                    strategist; John, the impulsive charmer; Ada, the idealistic rebel; and Finn, the innocent youngest.
                    Polly Gray, the matriarchal aunt,
                    acts as the true emotional backbone of the family. Later, Michael Gray, her rediscovered son, enters
                    the clan with his own ambitions.</p>
                <p class="2"><span>Each member brings their unique dynamic</span>. Arthur embodies brute force and blind
                    loyalty,
                    but his mental instability makes him unpredictable. John represents the balance between family life
                    and crime until his tragic death. Ada refuses the criminal empire but remains bound by blood. Polly
                    possesses the intelligence and intuition that complement Tommy's tactical genius. Michael, ambitious
                    and educated, progressively becomes a rival rather than an ally. Finn, raised in crime, symbolizes
                    the next generation.</p>
                <p class="3"><span>Family dynamics</span> constantly oscillate between absolute loyalty and potential
                    betrayal.
                    Tommy and Arthur share a bond forged in the trenches, but Tommy often manipulates his brother to
                    serve
                    his plans. The relationship with Polly combines mutual respect and conflicts over the family's moral
                    direction. Ada represents the conscience that Tommy systematically ignores. Michael's arrival
                    introduces
                    a generational and ideological fracture that will culminate in open confrontation.</p>
                <p class="4"><span>Allies and enemies</span> include Alfie Solomons, the unpredictable Jewish gang
                    leader whose
                    alliance with Tommy defies all logic; Aberama Gold, the gypsy king who seals his alliance through
                    marriage; and various corrupt politicians. Enemies are legion: Billy Kimber and his Birmingham gang,
                    Inspector Campbell and the police, the Italian Changretta mafia, Luca Changretta personally, fascist
                    Oswald Mosley, and ultimately Michael himself. Every alliance is temporary, every enemy potentially
                    deadly.</p>

            <h4>Iconic Locations</h4>
            <div class="contenu">
                <p class="1"><span>The Garrison Pub</span> is much more than a simple bar: it's the beating heart of the
                    Shelby
                    operation. Located on Garrison Lane, this establishment serves as a meeting room, informal tribunal,
                    and celebration venue. The private snugs at the back host the most delicate negotiations. The sober
                    decoration, the flowing Irish whiskey, and the smoky atmosphere create the perfect ambiance for
                    criminal
                    business. Every glass raised at the Garrison seals a pact or buries an enemy.</p>
                <p class="2"><span>Shelby Company Limited</span> represents Tommy's ambition for legitimacy. These
                    offices transform
                    a criminal operation into an apparently respectable business. Paneled walls, competent secretaries,
                    and carefully maintained records create the illusion of normality. Yet behind every legal
                    transaction
                    hides a criminal arrangement. It's here that Tommy orchestrates his boldest plans, transforming
                    dirty
                    money into clean investments.</p>
                <p class="3"><span>Arrow House</span> symbolizes the Shelbys' social ascension. This massive country
                    mansion, with
                    its stables, French gardens, and sumptuous salons, represents everything Tommy wanted to become.
                    Every
                    room breathes luxury and power. Yet the atmosphere remains cold, almost mausoleum-like. The ghosts
                    of
                    Tommy's past haunt these opulent corridors. Arrow House becomes as much a gilded prison as a palace,
                    isolating Tommy from the world he sought to conquer.</p>
                <p class="4"><span>Racetracks and racing grounds</span> constitute the Shelbys' original playground.
                    This is where
                    it all begins, with race-fixing and illegal betting. From Birmingham's muddy fields to Epsom's
                    prestigious
                    racetracks, these places represent the gang's evolution. The horses themselves become recurring
                    metaphors:
                    freedom, nobility, but also vulnerability. Every fixed race finances expansion, every legitimate
                    victory
                    reinforces the facade of respectability that Tommy meticulously constructs.</p>
            </div>

        <section id="4">
            <h4>Codes & Traditions</h4>
            <div class="contenu">
                <p class="1"><span>The rules of the underworld</span> in 1920s Birmingham follow strict tribal logic.
                    Loyalty to
                    family comes before everything. Betrayals are paid in blood. Verbal agreements have the force of
                    law;
                    breaking one's word is equivalent to signing a death warrant. Respect is obtained through force and
                    intelligence. Territories are sacred; crossing them without permission triggers war. These unwritten
                    codes govern every interaction, every negotiation, every conflict in this parallel world.</p>
                <p class="2"><span>The betting business</span> constitutes the foundation of the Shelby empire. In an
                    era when horse
                    racing is the national obsession and illegal betting flourishes, controlling bookmakers means
                    controlling
                    money. The system operates through a network of collectors, messengers, and enforcers. The Shelbys
                    don't
                    just take bets: they fix races, corrupt jockeys, and manipulate odds. This apparently simple
                    business
                    generates colossal fortunes.</p>
                <p class="3"><span>Gang wars</span> follow their own rituals. Warnings often precede violence: an
                    encrypted message,
                    a symbolic corpse, a show of force. Confrontations unfold according to tacit rules: no women or
                    children,
                    no police. Vendettas can last generations, each death calling for a response. The Shelbys excel in
                    this
                    organized violence, transforming each conflict into an opportunity for expansion. Brutality meets
                    strategy
                    in a precarious balance.</p>
                <p class="4"><span>Social ascension</span> represents the ultimate but most difficult goal to achieve.
                    Moving from
                    gangster to gentleman requires more than money: one must erase the past, acquire manners, establish
                    connections. Tommy uses several strategies: investing in legitimate businesses, frequenting the
                    right
                    people, entering politics, marrying into high society. Each step meets resistance and contempt from
                    the established aristocracy. The Shelbys' ascension illustrates British class struggle, where origin
                    remains an indelible mark despite acquired wealth.</p>
