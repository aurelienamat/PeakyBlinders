            <h4>Peaky Fashion</h4>
            <div class="contenu">
                <p class="1"><span>The Peaky Blinders' three-piece suits</span> have become iconic in popular culture.
                    Each outfit
                    consists of fitted trousers, a high-buttoning waistcoat, and a double-breasted or straight jacket,
                    all
                    in thick wool fabrics in dark shades: charcoal gray, navy blue, deep brown. The cuts are impeccable,
                    perfectly hugging the male silhouette. White or cream shirts, thin ties, and pocket watch chains
                    complete
                    the ensemble. This formal elegance deliberately contrasts with the violence of their activities.</p>
                <p class="2"><span>The flat cap</span>, the gang's distinctive element, deserves particular analysis.
                    Popular myth
                    claims the Peaky Blinders sewed razor blades into the visor to attack their enemies. Historically,
                    this
                    is largely a legend: disposable razor blades didn't exist yet during the gang's original era. In the
                    series, this image is preserved for its dramatic visual impact. The cap becomes a symbol of status,
                    belonging, and threat. Each member wears theirs with pride, tilted with precision.</p>
                <p class="3"><span>The 1920s dress style</span> reflects a transitional period. After World War I, men's
                    fashion
                    becomes more sober and functional. The Shelbys adopt this style but refine it, making it sharper.
                    Their
                    long wool coats, scarves, leather gloves all evoke a controlled and dangerous masculinity. Polished
                    boots replace fine shoes when action demands it. Every sartorial detail communicates power and
                    intention.</p>
                <p class="4"><span>The influence on contemporary fashion</span> is undeniable. Since the series aired,
                    three-piece
                    suits have experienced a resurgence in popularity. Flat caps are sold in trendy boutiques worldwide.
                    Fashion brands have created collections inspired by the Peaky Blinders. Online tutorials teach how
                    to
                    reproduce the look: invest in well-cut suits, favor natural fabrics, accessorize sparingly, wear
                    confidence
                    as the ultimate accessory. Peaky style transcends the era to become timeless.</p>

            <h4>Cinematography</h4>
            <div class="contenu">
                <p class="1"><span>Peaky Blinders' art direction</span> creates an immediately recognizable visual
                    universe. The
                    sets combine historical authenticity with dramatic stylization. Birmingham's streets are
                    reconstructed
                    with meticulous attention to detail: irregular cobblestones, weathered bricks, period posters. Yet
                    everything is slightly amplified, darker, more atmospheric than reality. Interiors oscillate between
                    the squalid poverty of slums and the icy opulence of aristocratic mansions. This visual duality
                    reflects
                    the Shelbys' ascension.</p>
                <p class="2"><span>Color choices and filters</span> define the series' identity. A desaturated palette
                    dominates:
                    steel gray, cold blues, earthy browns. The rare color explosions - the red of blood, the gold of
                    jewelry,
                    the emerald green of a dress - strike with all the more force. Cinematic grain adds an almost
                    tactile
                    texture to the image. Lighting favors strong contrasts, deep shadows, creating an aesthetic close to
                    film noir. These choices transform each shot into an expressionist painting.</p>
                <p class="3"><span>Iconic camera techniques</span> include dramatic slow-motion during key moments,
                    fluid tracking
                    shots following characters through streets, and intense close-ups capturing every micro-expression.
                    The
                    camera often adopts a subjective point of view, plunging us into Tommy's perspective. Movements are
                    calculated, never gratuitous. Framing frequently uses symmetry to suggest order and control, or
                    conversely
                    unbalanced compositions to evoke imminent chaos.</p>
                <p class="4"><span>The most iconic shots</span> remain etched in collective memory: Tommy walking in
                    slow motion
                    through Birmingham's foggy streets, cigarette on his lips; the family gathered around the council
                    table,
                    lit by harsh light; shootouts choreographed like deadly ballets; close-ups on Tommy's piercing blue
                    eyes.
                    Compared to other period series, Peaky Blinders rejects documentary realism for an almost
                    mythological
                    approach, transforming history into visual legend.</p>

            <h4>The Soundtrack</h4>
            <div class="contenu">
                <p class="1"><span>The anachronistic use of modern music</span> constitutes a bold choice that defines
                    Peaky Blinders.
                    Rather than using exclusively period compositions, the series integrates rock, modern blues, and
                    even
                    hip-hop. This temporal disconnect creates contemporary energy that makes the story more accessible
                    and
                    visceral. The opening credits with Nick Cave's Red Right Hand immediately establish the tone: dark,
                    menacing, hypnotic. This approach suggests that the themes - power, violence, ambition - are
                    timeless.</p>
                <p class="2"><span>Artists featured in the soundtrack</span> form a pantheon of alternative rock and
                    blues. Nick
                    Cave and the Bad Seeds dominate with several tracks. Arctic Monkeys bring their raw energy. We also
                    find
                    PJ Harvey, The White Stripes, Jack White, Tom Waits, Anna Calvi, and dozens of others. Each track is
                    selected for its emotional adequacy to the scene, creating powerful resonance. The music doesn't
                    comment
                    on the action, it amplifies it, transforming it into a total sensory experience.</p>
                <p class="3"><span>The impact of musical choices</span> is measured at several levels. Dramatically,
                    modern music
                    creates instant emotional bridges with contemporary audiences. Action scenes acquire heightened
                    cinematic
                    intensity. Contemplative moments gain poetic depth. Culturally, the series introduced a new
                    generation
                    to alternative artists, increasing their visibility. Several tracks experienced renewed popularity
                    after
                    their use in the series. The soundtrack has become cult independently of the series itself.</p>
                <p class="4"><span>A complete playlist</span> reveals the sonic progression through the seasons. Season
                    1 establishes
                    the foundations with Nick Cave, The White Stripes, and Arctic Monkeys. Season 2 introduces darker
                    sonorities with Anna Calvi and PJ Harvey. Subsequent seasons explore more varied territories,
                    including
                    melancholic folk, industrial rock, and even original orchestral compositions. This musical choice
                    works
                    because it refuses historical pastiche to capture the emotional spirit of the era rather than its
                    sonic
                    surface.</p>
            </div>

        <section id="4">
            <h4>Visual Symbolism</h4>
            <div class="contenu">
                <p class="1"><span>Horses</span> constantly appear as a multidimensional symbol. They first represent
                    the Shelbys'
                    original business, anchoring the gang in gypsy culture. More deeply, they symbolize the freedom
                    Tommy
                    desperately seeks but cannot attain. Scenes where Tommy rides suggest moments of temporary
                    liberation.
                    When a horse dies or suffers, it often foreshadows misfortune for the family. The animal's grace and
                    power reflect the Shelbys' own aspirations.</p>
                <p class="2"><span>Cigarette smoke</span> becomes an almost permanent visual signature. Tommy smokes
                    constantly,
                    each puff punctuating his reflection or tension. Visually, smoke creates mysterious veils, softens
                    contours, adds texture to the image. Symbolically, it represents the screen Tommy places between
                    himself
                    and the world, his way of masking his emotions. Smoke also evokes omnipresent industrialization,
                    Birmingham's
                    factories, the modernity devouring the old world. Each cigarette is a small act of conscious
                    self-destruction.</p>
                <p class="3"><span>Pocket watches</span> measure more than time. Tommy constantly consults his, obsessed
                    with precision
                    and temporal control. Giving or receiving a watch marks ritual moments of initiation or passage. The
                    ticking becomes a metaphor for time running out, mortality, the permanent urgency that drives Tommy.
                    In
                    several key scenes, the close-up on the watch creates unbearable tension. Time is the enemy that
                    even
                    Tommy Shelby cannot defeat, only manage.</p>
                <p class="4"><span>Whiskey and alcohol</span> punctuate every significant interaction. Pouring a drink
                    is a ritual
                    of negotiation, celebration, commemoration. The type of alcohol communicates status: Irish whiskey
                    for
                    origins, champagne for social ascension. Characters drink to forget, to celebrate, to seal
                    agreements.
                    Latent alcoholism runs through the entire family, a symptom of their traumas. Weapons also carry
                    ritual
                    significance: Tommy's revolver becomes an extension of his will, each chosen weapon communicates the
                    intention and style of its wielder.</p>
